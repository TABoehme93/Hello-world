# Hello-world

I am currently working on two projects to improve my coding skills.

This first is finished for what I am able to accomplish right now and I hope to have it up soon (date is 7/14/2016).  From this point I will see what suggestions I will get once others look at it.

The second is a game so that I can practice patterns.  I will give more information on it once I begin working it.
